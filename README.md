# Bot Car

## Setup

1. Download and extract the full source code, or clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Emik03/KeepCoding.git
```

2. Include a .env file containing the private key of your discord bot in the same directory as `bot.py`.

3. Go into `bot.py` and edit the constants `DEFAULT` (the embed to post in the event of no cars), `VIDEO_DIRECTORY` (directory of all videos), and `IMAGE_DIRECTORY` (directory of all images) accordingly.

4. Run this command. The program will initialize and create a `user_data.json` file. When a command is queried, `frequency_data.json` and `name_data.json` will be created.

```
python bot.py
```

A linter is used to determine on startup if duplicate or illegal cars exist in `user_data.json`.

## Usage

The bot uses the syntax ðŸš— (`:red_car:`) or ðŸš™ (`:blue_car:`) at the start of a message. Anything afterwards is called the **Query**.

- If the **Query** is empty, leaderboards are shown displaying the top 5 people with the most amount of cars.

- Otherwise, the **Query** is treated as a [`Regular Expression`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). The accuracy (%) car tells the **Query** result.

  - If the **Query** becomes empty, it posts the embed `DEFAULT`.

  - Otherwise, if the **Query** matches no car, the rightmost character is discarded until any match is found.

  - Otherwise, a random car of the set that match the **Query** is posted. The bot also states whether it is the first time the user has seen this car.

    - If the car hasn't been seen by the user ever, the car list increases for said user. This applies globally, meaning cars obtained in one server transfer over any other.

    - Otherwise, the embed will still posted but no increment is performed.
